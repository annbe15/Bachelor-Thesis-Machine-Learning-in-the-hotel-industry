Machine learning in the hotel industry: an automated sentiment and keyword analysis of online hotel reviews

The thesis explores machine learning in the hotel industry and how an automated analysis of hotel reviews can be implemented. New technological developments are introduced to the industry to further optimize it and make processes more efficient and time saving. The main area where machine learning is used is revenue management ranging from predicting booking cancellation to predicting future demand. Additionally, the use of chat boxes gives hoteliers the opportunity to focus on more crucial tasks and save time and resources. Furthermore, the analysis of guest reviews plays a crucial part in improving respective hotels as the feedback given shows where to improve and whether guests are satisfied or not. This leads to more satisfaction, guest recommendations and revenue. The analysis uses the text of the reviews only and is based on keyword analysis. The keywords are predefined and tailored to areas that are defined beforehand. Then a sentiment analysis is implemented to find out about how the hotel and the defined areas are perceived by guests. The last step is analyzing the results of the sentiment analysis and extracting the major factors that contribute to each of the sentiments in order to find out why the guests are satisfied or unsatisfied and what did not meet their expectations.
